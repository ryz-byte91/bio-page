                <p> Welcome to the world of Rylea! I am 32 and live in Ohio, USA. I am married to my husband Jake and we have a daughter Khloee. We also have three cats, Brock, Byrd, and Bill, and one dog, Odin. I have been coding since about 2019 and decided to make a career change into web design and programming in 2021. I have also started a business to sell my art and jewelry/accessories. A link to my business website is below.</p>
